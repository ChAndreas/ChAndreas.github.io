To build WebKit, you must have Xcode installed from the App Store. Then, run the following command in Terminal to install the Xcode Command Line Tools:
```zsh
xcode-select --install
```

**Cloning the WebKit Project**

Open Terminal on your macOS.
Use the following command to clone the WebKit repository from GitHub:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit.git WebKit
cd Webkit
```

**Building WebKit**

To build WebKit, run the following command in Terminal:
```zsh
./Tools/Scripts/build-webkit
```

**Building WebKit with Debug Flag and ccache**

To build WebKit with debugging information and improve recompile times, use the following command in Terminal:
```zsh
./Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --debug --use-ccache
```
The compilation will take about 20 minutes to complete.


**Running WebKit in Safari**
```zsh
./Tools/Scripts/run-safari --debug
```
